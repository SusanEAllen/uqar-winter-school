Regional Modelling and Open Boundaries
======================================

Notes and materials for the Regional Modelling and Open Boundaries Session

http://meopar.ca/ws2017-schedule


Session Description
-------------------

We will survey a number of issues that arise for regional models including: scale dependent parametrizations, topographic effects, hydrostatic approximation, available and suitable forcing data, bathymetry, how to handle river inflow and grid refinement.

Regional models required open boundary conditions.  We will consider the different types of boundary conditions, their advantages and disadvantages, stability and implications for model solutions.

Notes and Worksheet
-------------------

**Regional Models**

- Describe regional models, their purposes and some of their unique issues
- Analyze the scale dependence of a parametrization
- Discuss the input fields needed to force various types of models

Jupyter Notebook
----------------

`OpenBoundaryConditions.ipynb`_

**Open Boundaries**

An introduction to lateral boundary conditions using a simple shallow water equation model.
Closed, periodic, passive and active boundaries are considered.
